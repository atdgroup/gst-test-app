GStreamer test program for testing elements.

Will take source video from the videotestsrc or from a video file, run it through elements of you choice, including overlays etc. and then output video to the screen in a standalone window via autovideosink.



Legacy readme:
Based on the gst-app template for writing your own GStreamer-based app.

The code is deliberately kept simple so that you quickly understand the basics
of how to set up autotools and your source tree.

This template demonstrates :
- what to do in autogen.sh
- how to setup configure.ac (your package name and version, GStreamer flags)
- how to setup your source dir 
  - main () and main header
  - supporting source code
  - Makefile.am

The template performs one simple function : loading a pipeline from xml and
start to iterate it.  Try saving a pipeline from gst-editor, it will play
with this sample program.

More features might get added to this template later on.
